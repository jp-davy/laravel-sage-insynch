# Sage ERP In-Synch Starter Kit for Laravel

This collection of files will help you get started with [ROI In-Synch](https://www.roi-consulting.com/ "In-Synch for Sage by ROI Consulting") for [Sage ERP Software](https://www.sage.com/en-us/products/sage-100 "Sage 100 ERP Software"). Included are database migration files and Eloquent models.

This is not a comprehensive package for Laravel, but rather a collection of files to get your database and eloquent models setup quickly.

**Current Sage Version Supported:** Sage 100 2014 (5.10.4)

## Installation

You can clone this repository and copy/paste the migrations, and models into your project. Or you can browse the code here in the repository, and download only the files you need.

## Usage

Be sure to check through all of the migrations. As with any ERP, your Sage software might be customized for your company.

Make sure to change any namespaces on the models to fit your project structure. Basic default namespaces were used to create these models.

You can add any fields to the migrations as you wish, and add any methods to the models, including any eloquent relationships. Some basic eloquent relationships have been included, but your ERP installation may be customized differently.
